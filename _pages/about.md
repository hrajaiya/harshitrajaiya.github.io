Welcome to my website. I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at the Telfer School of Management, University of Ottawa. Prior to starting my current job, I graduated from Boston College with a PhD in Finance (May 2020).

My research interests are in empirical corporate finance and entrepreneurial finance. My current research focuses on financial policies, innovation, trademarks, initial public offerings (IPOs), seasoned equity offerings (SEOs), venture capitalists and angels, and FinTech.
